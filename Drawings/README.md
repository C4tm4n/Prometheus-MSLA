Place to store Drawings, for side panels etc. what need to be cut / manufactured
All the pannels can be cut in 4mm (5/32") Acrylique and/or ABS sheet (The door pannel needs to be transparent). You can use pretty much any kind of material but if you want to use tinner sheet keep in mind that you might need to change the screws length. 
The "Middle Plate" and the "Base Plate" need to be about 12.5mm (1/2") thick. You can use something like HDPE for easier cleaning of even MDF that you need to seal for cheaper price.
