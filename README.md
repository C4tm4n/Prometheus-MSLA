In greek mythology there is a legend of a Titan named Prometheus, he is known for defying the gods by stealing fire and gifting it back to humanity. 

Not only did he  give them fire Prometheus also taught the humans how to use the fire thus giving them the skill of metalwork then ensued the science and the arts allowing us to create anything today.

We created this project because we wanted to offer a machine that was accessible to everyone,we wanted it to be easily modified so that you can create and give your machine your own personal touch
